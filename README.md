# Next.js Shopify Starter

## Getting Started
Duplicate the `.env.local.template` file as `.env.local` and add in the appropriate values:
- `PRIVATE_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_DOMAIN` will be the `.myshopify.com` url for your store, eg. `xxxxx.myshopify.com`
- `PRIVATE_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_TOKEN` can be found in your custom app dashboard _(if you don't have one set up, see [Setting up a custom app](#setting-up-a-custom-app))_, under the API Credentials tab, as your `Storefront API access token`
- `PRIVATE_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_API_VERSION` - Shopify API version. Current API versions can be found in the [Shopify Docs](https://shopify.dev/api/usage/versioning)
